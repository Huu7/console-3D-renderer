Go to [Source.cpp](Source.cpp), copy the entire file, compile it to an exe or download the [consode 3D renderer.exe](x64/Release/console 3D renderer.exe) directly from here. Do not download exe files from anywhere untrustworthy on the internet.

After running it, use control and scroll bar or +/- to adjust font size to make the screen fully visible.
